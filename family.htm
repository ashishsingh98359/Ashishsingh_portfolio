        <pre style="font-size:27px;color:burlywood;">
            Mr. Keshav Narayan Singh, my father, is a 
            man whose life has been a living definition 
            of patience, dedication, and sacrifice. He 
            is a farmer by profession, but more than 
            that, he is the architect of my values and 
            the foundation of everything I am today. My 
            father’s life has never been easy. Yet 
            through every hardship, he carried one goal 
            in his heart—to give me an education and a 
            better future, even when that meant 
            enduring pain, poverty, and countless 
            sacrifices.</pre>
            <pre style="font-size:27px;color:cadetblue">
            My father’s days begin before sunrise. The 
            air is still cold when he steps into the 
            fields, his silhouette outlined by the 
            faint light of dawn. His hands, roughened 
            from years of labor, work tirelessly to 
            till the soil, sow the seeds, and nurture 
            the crops that keep our family alive. For 
            many people, farming is just an occupation. 
            For him, it is survival, identity, and 
            purpose. He never complains about the 
            physical exhaustion or the unpredictable 
            nature of his work. Droughts, floods, and 
            the fluctuating market prices have never 
            been able to take away his faith in effort. 
            He believes that hard work, even in the 
            harshest of circumstances, is a duty one 
            must never abandon.</pre>
            <pre style="font-size:27px;color:chartreuse">
            Our relationship was built on unspoken 
            words. I rarely saw him express his 
            emotions openly, yet his eyes revealed a 
            tenderness that words could not. He might 
            not have said he was proud, but I could 
            feel it in the way he looked at me when I 
            studied late at night or helped him in the 
            field. He believed that true appreciation 
            lies not in flattery but in encouragement 
            towards improvement. He never wanted me to 
            grow comfortable in praise; he wanted me to 
            grow stronger in discipline.</pre>

        If my father built the foundation of our lives, 
        then my mother, Ms. Asha Devi, is the heart 
        that pumps courage into every day we live. She 
        is about 45 years old, battling the last stage 
        of cancer with a strength that leaves everyone 
        who knows her in awe. Her illness is severe, 
        but her spirit refuses to break. Instead of 
        succumbing to fear or despair, she faces every 
        challenge with confidence and fierce 
        determination.
        </pre><pre style="font-size:27px;color:cornflowerblue">
        Our family is made up of two brothers and two 
        sisters, and my mother’s deep love flows 
        boundlessly toward each of us. More than once, 
        I have seen her worry not about herself but 
        about our wellbeing and happiness. Her love, 
        sometimes expressed in ways I did not 
        understand as a child, has always been the most 
        powerful force in our lives.
        </pre><pre style="font-size:27px;color:rgb(21, 142, 140)"><b>
        A story that reveals her profound love and 
        sacrifice is about a phone she brought for me. 
        She took money from my father without his 
        knowledge—not stealing to cause harm, but out 
        of a desperate desire to give me something that 
        could connect me to the world and help me in my 
        studies. At first, this act seemed wrong to me, 
        and perhaps to others too. But later, I 
        understood it was an act of love, a sacrifice 
        she made for us silently, without expecting 
        praise or thanks.</b>
        </pre><pre style="font-size:27px;color:darkorchid">
        Together, my parents have created a legacy of 
        sacrifice, love, and resilience—a legacy that 
        inspires me to work harder, dream bigger, and 
        live with integrity. I owe my confidence, my 
        dreams, and my hope to the two strongest people 
        I know: Mr. Keshav Narayan Singh and Ms. Asha 
        Devi. Their lives are the truest education I 
        have ever received.</pre>

        <pre style="font-size:27px;color:bisque">
        My younger brother, Chitj Kumar Singh, is 
        currently preparing for his 12th board exams 
        and also for NEET, the highly competitive 
        medical entrance examination. His academic 
        journey has not always been smooth. Like many 
        students, he struggled with studies in his 
        early years, often finding it difficult to keep 
        up and feeling discouraged by comparisons with 
        others.</pre><pre style="font-size:27px;color:fuchsia">
        A defining moment came when he decided to make 
        a bold shift: after class 8th, he left the CBSE 
        board and enrolled in the BSEB for classes 9th 
        and 10th. This was not an easy transition, but 
        he embraced it with determination. With 
        consistent effort and family support, Chitj’s 
        performance began to improve. He learned from 
        his setbacks and gradually developed a 
        disciplined approach to studies.</pre>
        <pre style="font-size:27px;color:deeppink">
        His hard work bore fruit in matriculation 
        (class 10th) examinations under BSEB, where he 
        scored 90 percent—an achievement that earned 
        him the A1 grade and the distinction of 
        “Outstanding” in the Bihar Board, according to 
        the latest grading system. This result was not 
        just a number; it was a testimony to how much 
        he had grown.
        </pre><pre style="font-size:27px;color:greenyellow">
        Chitj’s journey is a beautiful example for 
        anyone who feels defeated at first. He teaches 
        all of us that it’s never too late to change 
        and that persistence pays off. Today, he 
        studies sincerely and confidently, always 
        striving to reach his goals in the face of 
        obstacles. Our family is proud of his 
        transformation and continues to support his 
        dreams.

        My sister is 17 years old, and I love her 
        dearly. She has a very good nature—kind, 
        caring, and always considerate of those around 
        her. At 17, she is in a wonderful phase of life 
        where she is growing into a thoughtful and 
        mature young woman, yet still holds the 
        innocence and curiosity of youth.
        </pre><pre style="font-size:27px;color:lime">
        At seventeen, she is more in tune with her 
        emotions and the feelings of others. She is 
        sensitive without being fragile and has a 
        mature way of expressing herself. This 
        emotional intelligence makes her a 
        wonderful companion and a great source of 
        support to all of us. Whether it’s dealing 
        with everyday challenges or comforting 
        family members during hard times, she 
        approaches every situation with calmness 
        and understanding.
        </pre><pre style="font-size: 27px;color:royalblue">
        In conclusion, my 17-year-old sister is a 
        remarkable individual—a person with a heart 
        full of kindness, a mind full of hope, and a 
        soul full of love. Watching her grow and 
        flourish is a blessing, and I look forward to 
        seeing her achieve her dreams and become the 
        amazing woman she is destined to be.</pre></dd></dl></pre></dl></td><td><pre>                         <img src="NIDHI.png" alt="" width="600px" height="600px"></pre></td>

        My Elder Sister: A Pillar of Strength and Love
        My elder sister is 27 years old. She got 
        married in November 2019 and has a son, whom I 
        love very much. Despite the responsibilities of 
        her own small family, she has always been an 
        incredibly hardworking and supportive person in 
        our family, especially during difficult times.</pre><pre style="color:burlywood">
        When my mother fell ill, my sister came to stay 
        with us to take care of both my mother and my 
        younger sister, who is just 17. Her presence 
        brought much-needed comfort and strength to our 
        home. She took on the challenging task of 
        managing household responsibilities and 
        supporting our family during this tough period. 
        I deeply admire her dedication, patience, and 
        willingness to put others' needs before her own.</pre><pre style="color:mediumseagreen">
        In essence, my 27-year-old sister is more than 
        just a sibling; she is a pillar of strength and 
        a symbol of loving sacrifice in our family. Her 
        hard work, love, and support during my mother’s 
        illness have shown me what family means—a team 
        that uplifts each other through every 
        challenge. I am grateful every day for having 
        such a caring, strong sister who loves me 
        deeply and stands by us through thick and thin.</pre></dd></dl></dl>
