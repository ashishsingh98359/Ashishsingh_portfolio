    I have developed proficiency in C++ and Python, two 
    of the most powerful and widely-used programming 
    languages. Through learning and practice, I have 
    attained strong coding skills that allow me to 
    write efficient, clean, and effective programs.</pre>

        In C++, I have explored foundational concepts 
        such as object-oriented programming, memory 
        management, and understanding complex 
        algorithms. C++ has enabled me to handle 
        performance-critical applications and 
        understand low-level system operations, 
        including pointers and data structures like 
        linked lists, trees, and hash maps.</pre></dd></dl>
        <dl><dt style="color:blue">About Python skill :-</dt><dd><pre style="border-style: outset; border-width:10px">
            Python complements this by providing a 
            versatile, high-level programming 
            experience. I leverage Python for 
            scripting, automation, and data processing, 
            along with libraries for machine learning 
            and web development. The language’s 
            readability helps increase my productivity 
            and enhances my ability to prototype 
            solutions rapidly.</pre></dd></dl>

            Understanding Data Structures and 
            Algorithms (DSA) has been instrumental in 
            sharpening my problem-solving abilities. 
            DSA teaches me to approach coding 
            challenges methodically, optimize resource 
            usage, and implement efficient solutions 
            for sorting, searching, dynamic 
            programming, and graph problems. This 
            knowledge is fundamental for technical 
            interviews and real-world application 
            development.I have also completed My
            <strong>ADCA</strong> degree in 2022-2023 session.
            
            My combined expertise in C++, Python, and 
            DSA provides a solid foundation for 
            software development and prepares me for 
            tackling complex computational problems. It 
            strengthens logical thinking and equips me 
            with tools to create scalable and 
            maintainable codebases.</pre></dd></dl>

            I am adept at typing quickly and 
            accurately, a skill that significantly 
            boosts my efficiency in computer-related 
            tasks. This capability reduces the time 
            spent on data entry, coding, and content 
            creation, allowing me to focus on quality 
            and output volume.

            
            Good typing skills are essential in today’s 
            digitally-driven world as they impact 
            productivity across various domains,
